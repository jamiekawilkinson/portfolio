# Exploring the Achievement Gap: An Analysis of SAT Math Scores and Racial Demographics in High Schools

## Overview: Uncovering the Correlations Between Race and Academic Performance in Standardized Testing

The primary goal of this project was to investigate how the racial composition of high schools, particularly the percentage of Black students, influences the achievement gap in SAT Math scores across different racial groups.

### [scores.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nycopendata/high-schools)
The "scores.csv" file contains detailed information about various schools, focusing on their demographic makeup and academic performance in terms of SAT scores. Here's a brief summary of its key aspects:

1. **Basic School Information**: 
   - Includes data like 'School ID', 'School Name', 'Borough', 'Building Code', 'Street Address', 'City', 'State', and 'Zip Code'.

2. **Geographical Data**: 
   - Contains 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' for each school.

3. **School Operation Details**:
   - Information like 'Phone Number', 'Start Time', and 'End Time' of the school day.

4. **Student Demographics**:
   - Demographic breakdown in percentages, such as 'Percent White', 'Percent Black', 'Percent Hispanic', and 'Percent Asian'.

5. **Enrollment and Testing Data**:
   - Includes 'Student Enrollment' numbers and 'Percent Tested', indicating the proportion of students who took the SAT.

6. **SAT Performance**:
   - Academic performance data, with average scores for 'SAT Math', 'SAT Reading', and 'SAT Writing'.

## Key Results

This analysis underscores the existence of an achievement gap in SAT Math scores along racial lines. The observed trends point towards systemic issues in education, where race and ethnicity correlate with academic outcomes in standardized testing. It's crucial to emphasize that correlation does not imply causation; these findings reflect a need for deeper investigation into the underlying causes, such as socioeconomic factors, access to educational resources, and systemic biases, to develop effective strategies for educational equity.Â¶
