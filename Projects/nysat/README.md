# Analyzing Demographic Diversity and Academic Achievement in NYC High Schools (2014-2015)

## Overview

The focus of this research is to investigate whether there are variations in the average scores on SAT test sections among high schools in New York City during the 2014-2015 school year based on the diversity of their student populations, as indicated by the racial breakdown. This research is important for several reasons:

1. Educational Equity: Understanding the relationship between student diversity and SAT scores can shed light on potential disparities in educational opportunities and outcomes. It helps identify whether diverse schools face unique challenges or advantages in preparing students for standardized tests.

2. Policy Implications: The findings of this research can inform education policymakers and school administrators about the impact of student diversity on academic performance. It may lead to the development of strategies and policies aimed at improving equity and educational outcomes.

3. Resource Allocation: Schools with diverse student populations may require different resources and support systems. Identifying variations in SAT scores can help allocate resources effectively and tailor interventions to meet the needs of specific student groups.

4. College Readiness: SAT scores are often used as a predictor of college readiness. Understanding how diversity influences these scores can provide insights into the preparedness of students from different racial backgrounds for higher education.

5. Social and Cultural Understanding: Beyond academics, the research can contribute to a deeper understanding of the social and cultural dynamics within schools. It may highlight the role of diversity in fostering a more inclusive and enriched learning environment.
