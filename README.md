## Projects

### [Most Recently Uploaded Project: NY High Schools SAT Scores 2014-2015](Project-Link)

Objective:
The primary goal of this project was to investigate how the racial composition of high schools, particularly the percentage of Black students, influences the achievement gap in SAT Math scores across different racial groups.

Data Overview:
The analysis utilized a dataset containing information about various high schools, including racial demographics (percentages of White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian students) and average SAT scores (Math, Reading, Writing).

## Key Steps and Findings:

Data Preparation:
- Converted percentage columns (racial demographics) from string to numeric format for accurate analysis.

Correlation Analysis:
- Found a positive correlation between the percentage of White (0.596) and Asian (0.713) students and SAT Math scores.
- Identified a negative correlation for Black (-0.371) and Hispanic (-0.373) students with SAT Math scores.

Visual Analysis:
- Scatter plots with regression lines revealed distinct trends: Schools with higher percentages of White and Asian students typically had higher SAT Math scores. Conversely, a higher percentage of Black and Hispanic students was associated with lower SAT Math scores.

Interpretation:
- The analysis highlighted significant achievement gaps in SAT Math scores among different racial groups.
- The negative correlation for Black and Hispanic students indicates a pressing issue in educational inequality.

Conclusion:
- This analysis underscores the existence of an achievement gap in SAT Math scores along racial lines. The observed trends point towards systemic issues in education, where race and ethnicity correlate with academic outcomes in standardized testing. It's crucial to emphasize that correlation does not imply causation; these findings reflect a need for deeper investigation into the underlying causes, such as socioeconomic factors, access to educational resources, and systemic biases, to develop effective strategies for educational equity.

Next Steps:
- Further research is recommended to explore causal factors behind these disparities and to examine other aspects of academic achievement beyond standardized test scores. This could involve qualitative studies, policy analysis, and a closer look at the socio-economic context surrounding these schools.
